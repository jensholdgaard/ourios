//! The ingest pipeline — the §6.5 WAL-before-ack business-logic layer.
//!
//! Composes the pieces the earlier slices built (decode → fan-out) with
//! durability and templating: a decoded `ExportLogsServiceRequest` is
//! fanned out per tenant, the whole export is appended as one
//! `FrameKind::OtlpBatch` frame and **fsync'd before any ack**
//! (`CLAUDE.md` §3.4 / RFC0003.1), and only then are the records handed
//! to the miner (§6.5 step ordering). An empty batch takes the
//! fast path: success with no WAL write (RFC0003.12).
//!
//! The live gRPC/HTTP transports wrap this layer; they hand it a decoded
//! request and map its `Result` to the transport-level response.
