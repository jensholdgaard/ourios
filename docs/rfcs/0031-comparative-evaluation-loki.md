# RFC 0031 — Comparative evaluation against Grafana Loki

## 1. Summary

Pins the methodology for the one measurement the project has never
made: Ourios against the incumbent it defines itself against.
`CLAUDE.md` §1 states the existence test — *"Not a Loki/Mimir/
ClickHouse clone. If the answer is 'just use $X,' we should not be
building this"* — and to date every thesis-gate in
`docs/benchmarks.md` is self-referential (Ourios versus its own full
scan, versus `zstdcat | grep`). This RFC adds **Grafana Loki** as a
second reference system and fixes the comparative methodology: the
same OTLP stream ingested into both, the same logical queries run
against both on the same hardware, and a fixed set of comparative
gates (the **`L`-gates**) written into `docs/benchmarks.md`. The
headline corpus is a **real OpenTelemetry-Demo OTLP capture** — Ourios
is an OTLP-native backend, so the honest test is real OTLP logs, the
workload we claim to do best, not a favourable plain-text corpus. The
query taxonomy is anchored to OpenTelemetry's **own** stated log
correlation/analysis model (§2.3): the four must-win classes exercise
the four ways Ourios turns OTLP structure into pruning — template id,
resource/attribute columns, high-cardinality trace context, and typed
template parameters for frequency aggregation. The load-bearing metric
is **bytes read from object storage per query** — the implementation-
independent expression of the pruning thesis — with wall-clock latency
reported as practical corroboration. Result-set equivalence
(multiset-exact), a committed and competent (non-strawman) Loki
configuration, and mandatory publication of losses are acceptance
criteria, not afterthoughts. This RFC amends `docs/benchmarks.md` §1
(reference systems) and §7 (thesis-gate escalation); it does not touch
any `CLAUDE.md` §3 invariant or the Parquet schema.

## 2. Motivation

### 2.1 The thesis has only been tested against a strawman

`docs/benchmarks.md` §1 names exactly one reference system:
`zstdcat <file.zst> | grep <pattern>`. The B1 gate is "≥ 10× faster
than `zstdcat | grep`"; B2 is "scales with result size, not corpus
size." Both are real and both pass (§9.4, §9.8) — but both measure
the *mechanism*, not the *choice*. Parquet footer statistics do prune
row groups; the template count does converge. What no number in the
repository shows is that this beats the system a prospective user
would otherwise reach for. Loki also beats `zstdcat | grep`. The
question `CLAUDE.md` §1 raises — is there a reason to run Ourios
instead of Loki — is the project's existential question, and it is
unmeasured.

### 2.2 Why Loki, specifically

Of the three systems `CLAUDE.md` §1 names, Loki is the sharpest
comparison because it shares the *premise* and differs in the
*mechanism*. Both Ourios and Loki reject the full inverted index of
Elasticsearch/Quickwit; both store compressed log blocks on object
storage and lean on cheap storage plus selective reads. Where they
diverge is exactly the Ourios thesis:

- **Loki** indexes a small set of operator-chosen **labels** and,
  within the matching label streams, brute-force scans (greps)
  compressed chunks.
- **Ourios** mines a **template id** per line at ingest and leans on
  Parquet's per-row-group min/max statistics, bloom filters, and page
  indexes to skip chunks the query cannot match — *automatically*,
  without the operator choosing labels, and at a granularity finer
  than a label stream.

The comparison therefore tests the precise claim in `CLAUDE.md` §2
pillar #1–#2: that automatic template mining + Parquet pruning skips
more data than label-index + chunk scan on the selective queries that
dominate real log investigation. ClickHouse (general-purpose columnar)
and Quickwit (full-text index) are different enough in philosophy that
comparing to them answers a different question; they are noted in §4
and deferred.

### 2.3 OTLP is where the gap is widest, and OTel names the axes

The comparison runs on real OTLP logs (§3.3) because that is the
workload Ourios exists for, and because OTLP structure is exactly where
the two mechanisms diverge hardest. Critically, the query taxonomy is
not invented here: the OpenTelemetry Logs specification's [Log
Correlation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/#log-correlation)
section names the dimensions along which logs are navigated, filtered,
queried and analysed — *"these correlations can be the foundation of
powerful navigational, filtering, querying and analytical
capabilities"* — and they are precisely the axes Ourios prunes on:

- **Time of execution** — every query is time-bounded; Parquet
  row-group time statistics prune it.
- **Execution (trace) context** — `trace_id` / `span_id` on the
  LogRecord. The spec calls this out as what *"would make logs
  significantly more valuable in distributed systems"*: it directly
  correlates logs with traces and correlates logs *across* the
  components that served one request.
- **Resource context** — `service.name`, `k8s.*`, and other resource
  attributes identifying the telemetry's origin.

An OTLP log record arrives with `severity_number`, these resource
attributes, log attributes, and the trace context. Ourios promotes
this structure into **queryable, statistics-bearing columns
automatically** (template id at ingest per RFC 0001; severity,
service, and configured attributes as Parquet columns per RFC 0022),
so per-row-group min/max and bloom filters prune on OTLP fields
*without the operator declaring anything*. Loki's model is the
inverse: an operator must hand-pick a small set of **low-cardinality**
labels, and everything else is brute-force chunk scan. Four
consequences follow, and they are the four must-win query classes
(§3.4):

- Where template mining fires, Ourios prunes on **template id** (L1).
- Where it does not (the OTel-Demo capture is heavily `NO_TEMPLATE` on
  some services — RFC 0023), Ourios still prunes on the **promoted
  resource/attribute columns** (severity, `service.name` — L2). The
  pruning thesis on native OTLP is therefore *template mining +
  attribute promotion*, a stronger and more honest framing than a
  synthetic well-templated corpus would show.
- `trace_id` is **high-cardinality by construction**, so it cannot be
  a Loki label without exploding Loki's index. Loki must brute-force
  scan to answer "show me every log line for this trace"; Ourios
  promotes `trace_id` to a bloom-filtered column and prunes to the
  handful of row groups that contain it (L3).
- Template mining yields **typed parameters**, so "how often does
  template *X* fire over time, grouped by extracted field *Y*" is a
  columnar `GROUP BY` for Ourios. This is a first-class OTLP operator
  workflow — the canonical [OTLP-log query
  set](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/exporter/clickhouseexporter/README.md)
  opens with a severity-count time series, and an OTel-native vendor
  doing Drain-style mining demonstrates *"a log-frequency alert
  filtering on the pattern and grouping by the product-id field …
  without any metrics, without an extra metric, without a regular
  expression"* ([OTel Night, Berlin
  2025](https://github.com/open-telemetry/sig-end-user/blob/main/video-transcripts/transcripts/20250507T184836Z-otel-night-berlin-v2025-05-leveraging-ai-for-opentelemetry-data.md)).
  Loki, holding unstructured chunks and no typed params, must scan and
  regex-and-count. This is the workload the template + params pillar
  exists to serve (L4).

### 2.4 Why measurement now

The engineering is substantially complete (RFCs 0001–0030 green or
beyond; both data paths shipped and gated). The marginal green RFC no
longer changes whether the project should exist; the comparative
number does. `docs/benchmarks.md` §7 already states the discipline:
*"The worst failure mode for a greenfield project is shipping
something whose central claim quietly fails on real data and then
papering over it with more implementation."* An unmeasured
existential comparison is that failure mode latent. This RFC converts
it into a gate — one that can be **lost**, and whose loss is a
pillar-level signal, not a tuning knob.

### 2.5 Why bytes-read is the primary metric, not latency

Ourios is a young implementation on top of DataFusion; Loki is a
mature engine with years of query-path optimisation. A naive
latency-only comparison confounds two very different claims —
*"Parquet pruning reads less data"* (an architectural claim, the
thesis) and *"our query engine is faster today"* (an implementation-
maturity claim, not the thesis). We isolate the thesis by making the
primary gate **bytes read from object storage per query**: the direct,
engine-independent measure of how much data each architecture must
touch to answer a query. Pruning is, definitionally, reading less.
Wall-clock latency (p50/p99) is reported alongside as the number an
operator actually feels, but a *latency* loss paired with a decisive
*bytes-read* win is interpreted as "sound architecture, young
implementation" — a roadmap signal — whereas a *bytes-read* loss on a
selective query is a thesis failure. This asymmetry is the honesty
core of the RFC and is fixed in §5, not left to interpretation after
the fact.

## 3. Proposed design

### 3.1 Shape

A new comparative bench workstream, layered on the RFC 0006 harness
and the RFC 0007 querier, that:

1. Ingests one fixed corpus into **both** systems over their native
   OTLP path (§3.3).
2. Runs a fixed **query taxonomy** (§3.4) against both, expressed once
   in the Ourios DSL and once in LogQL, asserting **result-set
   equivalence** (§3.5) before any timing is trusted.
3. Records the **`L`-gate** metrics (§3.6) into `docs/benchmarks.md`
   §9 in the same diff-reviewable shape RFC 0006 established.
4. Ships the **exact Loki configuration** and orchestration in-repo so
   the comparison is third-party-reproducible (§3.7).

The Ourios-side numbers come from the existing querier and its OTel
query metrics (RFC 0016: `scanned` / `pruned` row-group counts, which
this RFC extends to bytes — §3.6). The Loki-side numbers come from
Loki's own query-statistics API (`Summary.totalBytesProcessed`,
`execTime`), which Loki returns per query — no instrumentation of
Loki's internals is required or permitted (that would be a fairness
hazard).

### 3.2 Infrastructure

Both systems run as containers under GitHub Actions (containerd; no
local Docker dependency), against the **same object-store backend** — a
single MinIO/localstack S3 endpoint — so the storage substrate is
byte-for-byte identical and cannot bias the bytes-read metric. Loki
runs in single-binary mode with the `tsdb` index and S3 chunk storage;
Ourios runs its normal ingester + querier against the same bucket. Per
the established norm (`benchmarks.md` §1, and the project's
bench-on-`ci-runner`-first discipline), the first comparative run is
**indicative on `ci-runner`**; the authoritative run is on the
`baseline-8vcpu-32gib` tag and is gated on maintainer opt-in. Neither
system is co-scheduled with the other during a timed query (they share
a bucket, not a CPU): ingest both, then quiesce, then query each in
isolation with the other stopped, to remove noisy-neighbour effects
from the latency numbers.

### 3.3 Corpus and ingest parity

The **headline** corpus is the **OTel-Demo v8 capture** — the canonical
real-OTel corpus per the project's corpus policy, native OTLP with the
full attribute/`trace_id` structure §2.3 turns on. This is the number
the project stands behind. It is worth stating plainly that the
OTel-Demo logs are comparatively *well-structured* (shipped over OTLP
as JSON with rich attributes); real-world Kubernetes logs are typically
messier raw-string bodies with only basic attributes (OTel Night 2025,
ibid.). So OTel-Demo is the honest OTLP headline but not a worst case —
the harder real case (mostly `NO_TEMPLATE`, sparse attributes) is
exactly where attribute promotion and the L4 aggregation carry the
thesis, and §7 keeps "a messier captured corpus" as a follow-up. **LogHub
HDFS_v1** (already wired, bench-time-fetched, ~1.47 GiB) is retained as
a **secondary, well-templated sanity floor** — it reproduces the best
case for template mining and anchors against the Drain-paper corpora —
but it is explicitly not the headline, and it is non-native (plain text
replayed as text-body OTLP), so it exercises template pruning without
the OTLP-attribute story.

Both corpora are fed to both systems as the *same* OTLP log stream: a
single replay driver emits OTLP/gRPC to Ourios's receiver and, in
parallel, to Loki over OTLP (native OTLP endpoint preferred, or an OTel
Collector `loki` exporter — §7), so neither system gets a preprocessing
advantage and both derive their structure from the identical OTLP
records. Label selection for Loki is part of the committed config
(§3.7) and must be a *competent operator's* choice (`service.name`,
`severity`, a small set of low-cardinality resource attributes), **not**
a single catch-all label that would force a full scan (an unfair
strawman in Ourios's favour), **nor** a high-cardinality label
(`trace_id`, or one label per template) that smuggles Ourios's promoted
columns into Loki's index and would blow it up in a real deployment (an
unfair strawman in Loki's favour, and not how anyone operates Loki).
The label set is frozen in the config and machine-checked as the §5
RFC0031.10 gate.

### 3.4 Query taxonomy

Seven query classes, each with a must-win / acknowledged-loss / floor /
parity disposition fixed up front so the result cannot be reframed after
it is known. The four must-win classes map one-to-one onto OTel's log
analysis axes (§2.3) and the four ways Ourios turns OTLP structure into
pruning:

| Class | Query | OTel axis / Ourios pruning mechanism | Disposition |
|-------|-------|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| **L1** | Template-exact lookup: all lines of one rare template over the full corpus | body pattern → template id (RFC 0001) | **must-win** (thesis) |
| **L2** | Attribute predicate: `severity ≥ ERROR AND service.name = X` over a bounded window | resource context → promoted columns + Parquet stats (RFC 0022) | **must-win** (thesis) |
| **L3** | Trace correlation: every log line for one `trace_id` | execution context → high-cardinality bloom column | **must-win** (thesis, OTLP-native) |
| **L4** | Frequency aggregation: count of a template over time, grouped by an extracted param | typed template params → columnar `GROUP BY` | **must-win** (thesis, OTLP-native) |
| **L5** | Substring needle: an arbitrary literal *not* captured by a template or a promoted column (embedded in a param) | none (brute scan for both) | **acknowledged** — loss permitted, published |
| **L6** | Broad scan: all lines in a wide time range, low predicate selectivity | little prunes | **floor** — bounded, not must-win |
| **L7** | Ingest throughput: sustained OTLP lines/s to steady state | — | **parity** — within a stated factor |

L1–L4 are where the pruning thesis lives and must win on bytes-read
(§3.6). L3 and L4 are the two Loki *structurally* cannot serve
efficiently: L3 because `trace_id` cannot be a label, L4 because Loki
holds no typed params and must scan-then-regex-and-count where Ourios
does a columnar aggregation. L5 is the honest inclusion: neither
template mining nor attribute promotion helps a substring the miner
folded into a parameter, and Loki's brute-force chunk grep may match or
beat Ourios there — we publish it. L6 tests the floor (when little can
be pruned, Ourios must not be *catastrophically* worse — bounded, not
required to win). L7 checks that thesis-side query wins are not bought
with an unacceptable ingest regression.

### 3.5 Result-set equivalence (the integrity gate)

A latency or bytes comparison between two queries that return different
answers is meaningless. For every query in the taxonomy, the harness
compares the two systems' answers **exactly** before any metric for that
query is recorded:

- For the line-returning classes (L1–L3, L5, L6) it extracts each
  system's matching lines keyed by `(timestamp_unix_nanos, body_bytes)`
  and compares as a **multiset** — the *count* of each key must match,
  not merely the set, so a system returning three identical duplicate
  lines where the other returns two is a mismatch, not a silent pass.
- For the aggregation class (L4) the grouped result itself is the answer:
  the `(bucket, group_key) → count` map must be identical between
  systems.

A mismatch fails the run (non-zero exit, no metric written for that
class) — it means the two queries are not asking the same question and
the comparison is invalid. This is RFC0031.1 and it gates every other
`L`-scenario.

### 3.6 Metrics and the bytes-read extension

Per query, per system, the harness records:

- **`bytes_read`** — bytes fetched from object storage to answer the
  query. Ourios: extended from the RFC 0016 `scanned`/`pruned`
  row-group counts to the **bytes** of the row groups actually read
  (footer + read row-group byte length), emitted on the existing OTel
  query-metrics path. Loki: recorded on **two channels** (definitions
  in the 2026-07-13 amendment below): storage-side
  (`compressedBytes + headChunkBytes`) and processed
  (`totalBytesProcessed`); each frozen gate cites one (§7).
  **Primary gate metric** — with the rationale applying to Ourios's
  figure and Loki's storage-side channel; the processed
  channel measures decompressed engine work, not fetched bytes.
  Because the storage-side comparison counts bytes fetched
  from the shared object store, it is by construction insensitive to
  CPU speed and engine maturity; to keep it insensitive to local page
  cache as well, each measured query runs against a **freshly started**
  server with OS page cache dropped, so a warm local cache cannot mask
  an architecture that would fetch more from storage.
- **`latency_p50` / `latency_p99`** — wall-clock over N repetitions,
  reported for both a **cold** reading (fresh process, dropped cache —
  the same state the bytes-read gate is measured in) and a **warm**
  reading (repeated in-process), stated separately. Corroborating, not
  sole-gating (§2.5).
- **`storage_footprint`** — total bytes each system persists for the
  corpus on the shared bucket. Recorded **diagnostic** (like A1, per
  RFC 0011 — a byte codec captures redundancy the thesis does not
  claim to beat); not gating.
- **`ingest_throughput`** — steady-state OTLP lines/s (L7 only).
- **`peak_rss`** — high-water memory of each system's query path,
  diagnostic.

### 3.7 Reproducibility and anti-strawman commitment

The entire comparison — Loki config (index, chunk, retention, S3,
label selection), the OTLP-into-Loki config (native endpoint or an OTel
Collector `loki` exporter — §7), the query pairs (DSL ↔ LogQL), and the
orchestration — is committed under `bench/comparative/` and runnable by
a third party with one command. The Loki configuration must be a
**good-faith competent** deployment: tuned chunk target size,
appropriate index period, the label set from §3.3. The config carries a
header comment inviting challenge, and the `L`-gate results in
`benchmarks.md` §9 link the exact config commit. Crucially the label
set is **machine-checked**, not merely eyeballed (RFC0031.10): a test
asserts the committed labels are drawn from a declared low-cardinality
allowlist and that the disallowed keys (`trace_id`, `span_id`, and any
per-template id) are absent, so a strawman config cannot slip in
unnoticed. A benchmark whose loser's configuration cannot be inspected
and re-run is not evidence; this section is what makes the number
defensible rather than a claim.

### 3.8 `benchmarks.md` amendments

- **§1** gains Loki as a second reference system, described as above.
- **§7** gains the `L`-gate escalation: an L1, L2, L3, or L4
  **bytes-read** loss on the headline OTel-Demo corpus is a
  **pillar-level** finding (revisit `CLAUDE.md` §2 before further
  implementation), exactly as two failing thesis-gates are today. A
  must-win *latency* loss with a bytes-read win is a roadmap item, not
  an escalation. L5 (substring) loss is expected and never escalates.
  L6 beyond its floor, or an L7 regression past its factor, is a tuning
  RFC.

## 4. Alternatives considered

**Compare against ClickHouse instead of Loki.** ClickHouse is the
closest system *architecturally* (columnar, statistics-based skipping),
so a ClickHouse comparison would test "did we build a worse
ClickHouse" rather than "should you use Ourios over the log-native
incumbent." It is the more flattering comparison to defer and the more
dangerous one to skip; it belongs in a follow-up RFC once the Loki
number exists, because losing to ClickHouse-on-logs is a distinct and
also-existential finding. Deferred, not dismissed.

**Compare against Quickwit / Elasticsearch.** These carry a full-text
inverted index — the exact structure `CLAUDE.md` §2 claims to collapse.
They will win outright on arbitrary substring search (L5-like queries)
and pay for it in storage and ingest. That trade is already understood
and is not the question Ourios's thesis stakes itself on; benchmarking
it measures a different product. Out of scope (`benchmarks.md` §8
already excludes SIEM-style full-text latency).

**Keep `zstdcat | grep` as the only reference.** This is the status
quo and it is insufficient for the reason in §2.1: it validates the
mechanism, not the choice. Retained as a floor, not removed.

**Latency as the primary gate.** Rejected in §2.5: it confounds the
architectural thesis with implementation maturity and would let a
young-engine latency loss read as a thesis failure (or, worse, tempt us
to chase engine micro-optimisation to rescue a number that the
architecture already wins on bytes). Bytes-read is the honest primary.

**No result-set equivalence check — just run "the same query" in each
DSL.** Rejected: LogQL and the Ourios DSL have different matching
semantics (label streams vs template ids vs substrings), and "looks
equivalent" is exactly how comparative benchmarks lie. §3.5 makes
multiset-exact equivalence a hard precondition.

**Make it an RFC 0006 amendment rather than a new RFC.** RFC 0006 pins
the *self-referential* thesis-gate methodology; this introduces a
second system, an equivalence harness, and a fairness contract — enough
new surface, and enough new failure modes, to warrant its own decision
record. It references RFC 0006's harness rather than editing it.

## 6. Testing strategy

Per `CLAUDE.md` §6.2, mapped to the §5 scenario ids:

- **Equivalence harness (RFC0031.1)** — an integration test over a
  small committed fixture corpus (not the full OTel-Demo/HDFS fetch)
  that runs a DSL↔LogQL pair against a containerised Loki and the
  in-process querier and asserts multiset-equality of the keyed line
  sets (and grouped-count maps for L4); a deliberately mismatched pair,
  and a duplicate-count mismatch, both assert the non-zero-exit /
  no-write path.
- **`L`-gate computation (RFC0031.2–RFC0031.9)** — unit tests over
  recorded/synthetic per-query metric inputs assert the ratio math, the
  pass/fail dispositions, and the diagnostic-vs-gating distinction
  (mirroring RFC 0006's `a1`/`c2` gate-math unit tests). The margins
  `M_L1`, `M_L2`, `M_L3`, `M_L4`, `F_L6`, `F_L7` are configuration, so a
  calibration test pins their wiring, not their values.
- **Bytes-read metric extension (RFC0031.2–.5)** — a querier test
  asserts the new bytes-read figure equals the summed byte length of
  the row groups the RFC 0016 path reports as `scanned` (and excludes
  `pruned`), so the primary gate metric is verified against the
  existing pruning counters rather than trusted.
- **Config machine-check (RFC0031.10)** — a test parses the committed
  Loki + OTLP-path configs, asserts the label allowlist / disallowlist
  property, and asserts the documented one-command entry point exists
  and references them.
- **Full comparative run (RFC0031.11)** — a `workflow_dispatch` job
  (indicative on `ci-runner` first, authoritative on
  `baseline-8vcpu-32gib` on opt-in) ingests the OTel-Demo capture (the
  headline) and HDFS_v1 (the secondary floor), runs the taxonomy end to
  end, and appends the §9 table. Not a per-PR gate (it fetches large
  corpora and runs two systems); it is the RFC-`validated` step,
  consistent with `benchmarks.md`'s authoritative-run cadence.

Validation (`benchmarks.md` §7): RFC 0031 reaches `validated` when the
authoritative comparative run has been recorded in §9 with L1, L2, L3,
and L4 passing on the headline OTel-Demo corpus. A must-win failure does
not block `validated` in the "we didn't finish" sense — it is a
*result*, and per §5 RFC0031.11 a pillar-level one.

## 7. Open questions

- [x] **Must-win margins — PARTIALLY FROZEN (2026-07-13, informed by the
  `benchmarks.md` §9.13 calibration record — whose channel choice was
  still open at its writing; this amendment resolves it. Maintainer
  delegated).**
  `M_L1 = 10` and `M_L3 = 10` are **frozen** on the storage-side
  channel (the conservative one, §3.6 channel definitions): both classes clear it with
  headroom (L1 77.2–77.7×, L3 21.2–21.9×) across 3–4 consecutive
  equivalence-verified runs, and both wins are structural rather
  than tuned. `M_L2` is **deferred with a named condition**: the
  measured storage-side band is 1.05–1.31× — an honest parity, not a
  10× claim — and two named levers (the RFC 0033 cached template
  map, constant 513,862 bytes per query, and write-side sizing) are expected
  to move it; freeze after RFC 0033 lands. Until then L2 gates on
  the processed channel at `M = 10` (measured 32.5–39.3×),
  with the storage-side figure recorded as informational. `M_L4` is
  **deferred until L4 is first measured** (query shape below).
  Rationale for the split channels is the `benchmarks.md` §9.13 assessment: the
  storage channel is the conservative claim where we can make it,
  and the processed channel measures the work the §1 thesis
  eliminates.
- [x] **Floor / parity factors — F_L6 FROZEN, F_L7 DEFERRED
  (2026-07-13).** `F_L6 = 3` is **frozen on the latency channel, as
  RFC0031.7 is written**: run #18 measured all three window pairs
  inside the floor (ratios 0.34 / 3.43 / 1.32, oriented
  `loki_p50 / ourios_p50` so > 1 means Ourios is faster; the floor
  passes at ≥ 1/3 — Ourios outright faster on two of three). Harness
  alignment (asserting the frozen gates instead of reporting them)
  lands in the companion slice immediately after this amendment. The window pairs' **bytes** figures
  are reclassified from a gated floor to a **published diagnostic**
  (`informational` bar, `benchmarks.md` taxonomy): the storage-channel
  loss (0.003–0.018 across the record; 0.007–0.018 on current
  code, post-#486) is real, structural to time-partitioned chunks
  vs columnar layout, small in absolute terms (≤ 4.5 MB), and its
  only lever is the write-side layout fork — publishing it honestly
  is the commitment; gating on it would gate on a number we do not
  intend to chase. `F_L7 = 2` stays **deferred until L7 (ingest
  parity) is first measured**.
- [ ] **L4 aggregation query shape.** Which template + param + bucket
  width best represents the real alerting/dashboard workload on the
  OTel-Demo corpus, and how is the LogQL equivalent (pattern/`label_format`
  extraction + `count_over_time … by`) pinned so RFC0031.1 equivalence
  is achievable? Confirm against LogQL's current metric-query surface at
  implementation time.
- [x] **Headline corpus — DECIDED: OTel-Demo.** Ourios is an OTLP-native
  backend, so the honest headline is real OTLP logs — the workload the
  project claims to do best — not the favourable well-templated HDFS_v1.
  HDFS_v1 is retained only as a secondary well-templated sanity floor
  (§3.3). A messier real-world captured corpus (sparse-attribute k8s
  text) is a worthwhile follow-up but not required for the first result.
  (Maintainer decision, 2026-07-11.)
- [ ] **Loki index backend.** `tsdb` (current Loki default) vs
  `boltdb-shipper`. Pick the one a competent 2026 operator would deploy;
  likely `tsdb`. Confirm against Loki's current guidance at
  implementation time.
- [ ] **OTLP → Loki path.** Loki's native OTLP endpoint vs an OTel
  Collector with the `loki` exporter. Native OTLP is the fairer
  apples-to-apples (both consume OTLP directly); confirm label derivation
  is equivalent to the frozen set either way.
- [ ] **New crate vs `ourios-bench` extension.** Does the comparative
  driver + equivalence harness live in `ourios-bench` or a new
  `bench/comparative/` (non-crate) harness plus a small querier-side
  metric addition? A new crate is a `CLAUDE.md` §7 commitment; a harness
  under `bench/` is not. Leaning `bench/` + a querier metric extension.
  **Maintainer call.**
- [ ] **Does this touch `docs/hazards.md`?** The comparison itself adds
  no runtime hazard, but the bytes-read metric extension touches the
  RFC 0016 query-metrics path; confirm no regression to those counters.
